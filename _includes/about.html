    <h1>Hacking for #innovation</h1>

      <h2>We are hackers...</h2>
      <p>We help teams and organisations adopt the #hacker_mindset in their digital transformation:</p>
      <ul class="green-list">
        <li>to learn through creative and clever experimentation</li>
        <li>to guide decisions with intellectual honesty based on data-driven evidence and direct access to the sources of knowledge and thought leadership</li>
        <li>to get from zero to revenue</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We inspire the next generation of #hackers to engage in and live the #hacker_culture:</p>

      <ul class="green-list">
        <li>to enjoy the intellectual challenge of solving fascinating problems</li>
        <li>to inhabit the same spaces with other makers of cool useful things -- craftsmen, writers, painters and other hackers</li>
      </ul>
