## This manifesto is the declaration of the intentions, motives and views of the [hacker.works](/about) group

### 1. Understanding & Responsibility

> #### "No one enjoys his work if he is a cog in a machine."
> ------ Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language. Towns.Buildings.Construction.

A hacker enjoys his work when he *understands* the whole and when he is *responsible* for the quality of the work. He can only *understand* the whole and be *responsible* for the whole when the work which happens in the [hacker.works](/about) group, all of it, is undertaken by small semi-governing, self-organized groups of hackers; groups small enough to give people *understanding* through face-to-face contact, and autonomous enough to let the hackers themselves govern their own affairs.

### 2. We See People

[hacker.works](/about) as our vocation and workplace, is a form of living, with its own intrinsic rewards. Any way of organizing work which treats work instrumentally, as a means only to other ends, is inhuman.

*Hackers* are *people*!

### 3. Autonomy

Our self-direction is a natural inclination. We as hackers enjoy to explore all on our own. We are all built with inner drive. This involves taking the *control* of and *responsibility* for our actions and destinies rather than just waiting for someone else to give us the answers.  

At [hacker.works](/about) we have real *control* over the various aspects of our work -- whether it's deciding what to work on or when to do it, or how to do it.

### 4. Intellectual Honesty

> #### A hacker is being intellectually honest when he or she, knowing the truth, states that truth.
> ------ a slightly modified Google search [result](https://www.google.bg/webhp?ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=intellectual%20honesty)

We see *intellectual honesty* as a kernel method for problem solving, that can be demonstrated in a number of ways:

* Hacker's personal beliefs do not interfere with the pursuit of truth;
* Relevant facts and information are not purposefully omitted even when such things contradict a hacker's hypothesis;
* Facts are not twisted to give misleading impressions or to support a hacker's view over another;
* References, or earlier work, are acknowledged where possible, and plagiarism is avoided;
* Addressing the argument instead of attacking the person making the argument.

### 5. Hacker Culture

[hacker.works](/about) is a group of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations and problems to achieve novel and clever outcomes.

### 6. Craft over Art

> #### "Craftsmanship is built upon strong relationships. Focus on delivering value to your customer over advancing your own self-interests."
> ------ David H. Hoover, Adewale Oshineye, Apprenticeship Patterns ([DRM free ebook](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html))

As hacker craftsmen we are primarily building software and products that serve the needs of others, not indulging in artistic expression. We do our best work in ways that place the interests of our clients over our own desire to display skill or pad our resumes, while adhering to the professional standards of competence provided by the software development community.

### 7. Better

> #### â€œ...a way to recognize the inadequacies in what you do and to seek out solutions"
> ------ Atul Gawande, Better

As hackers we have the need to always be adapting and changing based on the feedback we get from the world around us.

As hackers we are encouraged to explore ideas that remind us of what is possible, that inspire us to think differently and trigger us to explore *better* ways of doing our work. Once a hacker's mind is stretched by a new idea, practice or a *better* tool, it will never return back to its original position. 

### 8. Pragmatism over Dogmas & Idealism

At [hacker.works](/about) we're willing to trade off theoretical purity, idealistic dogma and future perfection in favour of getting things done today. 

There are bills to be paid, relationships and families to be taken care of, kids to be fed... Getting rich; building the wealth together; and getting forth the goods and services needed for a becoming existence is what we consider *pragmatic*.

### 9. Taste & Aesthetics

The aesthetic quality of our work at [hacker.works](/about) is integral to the usefulness of our work, and on the effect it has on our clients and colleagues and their well-being. 

### 10. Childlike Minds

> #### Cooper: "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here."
> ------ Interstellar, Quotes ([permalink](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/quotes?item=qt2253996))

We hackers crave to be inspired. We believe in a more brilliant world. That's an idea that requires a childlike state of wonder. The being there, done that of the adult mind is a form of laziness. We need to re-engage with our senses; awaken the mind's attention from this lethargy of custom and familiarity, and redirecting it instead to the wonders of existence. 

We're all born artists; we're all born explorers and ecstasy seekers; we strive to reenter these spaces, the only spaces that had led to the visions that have transformed the world.
